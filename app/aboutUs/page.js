            If your feet are hurting in your shoes you could be doing damage.
            Itâ€™s not something you think about at the time, but that pain in
            your foot may affect you now and further down the track. Your feet,
            under undue pressure, pain or stress, will impact your joints,
            tendons, muscles... the list goes on.
